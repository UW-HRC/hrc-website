Husky Running Club has no official "membership" requirement; all students are welcome to come running with us anytime they wish. However, if you plan to run with us regularly, we do recommend that you do a few things to help us and you:

- Fill out an <a href="https://ima.rsp.washington.edu/Course/Search.aspx" target="_blank">IMA waiver</a> for HRC, which helps us with liability and funding <a href="/assets/pdf/HowToSignTheOnlineWaiver.pdf" target="_blank">(instructions)</a>,
- Follow our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwhuskyrunningclub/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to get important updates about the club,
- Explore our [routes](/routes).

Once you're comfortable with the club, you can become a [run leader](/officers/responsibilities.html#run_leaders) or apply for an [officer position](/officers/responsibilities.html), if you're into that sort of thing.
