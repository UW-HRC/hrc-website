Husky Running Club has no official "membership" requirement; all students are welcome to come running with us anytime they wish. However, if you plan to run with us regularly, we do recommend that you do a few things to help us and you:

#### Fill Out IMA Waiver For HRC

- First visit <a href="https://reg.recreation.uw.edu/" target="_blank">the UW recreation site</a> and login with your UW NetID by clicking the "Log In" link in the upper lefthand corner and choosing "Sign in with UW NetID."
- Then <a href="https://reg.recreation.uw.edu/Waiver?productId=5aadc2ad-34da-4b62-b725-f3ea15f74a5d&entityTypeId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000003586&partyId=a92407e7-cf2c-4435-9f89-a8edd23a3d09&relatedEntityId=3d846033-9a77-4abb-9ecd-f5971f3c0162" target="_blank">click here</a> to sign the waiver online. To sign the document, you must <b>click</b> on the grey box at the bottom, and a modal will appear in which you can use your cursor to sign.
- You will be guided through the process of adding emergency contacts. Once finished, click "Check Out" -- it appears like an online cart, but the price is free, so don't worry.
