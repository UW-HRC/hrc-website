Husky Running Club does not technically have members, although in order to be eligible to run with us, please fill out this liability waiver and either bring it to club and give it to an officer or email it to us.

One of the coolest things about Husky Running Club is our lack of membership. We do not promote any specific type of runner, although we support all of them and cultivate an environment in which people from all skill levels can come together and grow as people and as athletes. We have established a great support system to literally guide you through it. Below are our beloved run leaders. If you ever need any help on the trail, look to them and they will be happy to assist you.
